Example: Random Move Strategy

This is a simple demonstration strategy that randomly selects moves.
It serves as a minimal working example for developers learning to create
their own chess AI strategies.

    A naive strategy that randomly selects from available legal moves.

    This implementation demonstrates the minimum requirements for a Strategy:
    1. Inherit from StrategyBase
    2. Implement the choose_move() method
    3. Return a valid move in SAN notation

    The strategy intentionally ignores the board position, player color, and
    search_time parameter - it simply picks a random legal move instantly.

        Randomly select one move from the list of legal moves.

        This method receives three pieces of information:
        - board: The current chess position (unused in this naive example)

        - player_color: Whether we're playing "white" or "black" (unused here)
